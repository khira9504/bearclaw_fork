## what's a static site generator
a static site is a site with no fancy clicky things, signups, comments, just plain html. writing a raw html page for your blog makes it load very fast, but there's a lot of typing involved when designing it. markdown is a simpler and faster way to write pages, and bearclaw converts those markdown files to html for you, with your style template. 

no node-modules, no react, no fancy stuff or cool emojis. it just works.

## how do we use it?
bearclaw can be run on-demand, or it can rebuild automatically when it sees changes. there are 3 folders in the basic install: `markdown`, `output`, and `templates`. there is an optional 4th folder after v1.2.0 for `plugins`.

- **markdown** - all your new posts go here
- **output** - bearclaw puts your html and rss here
- **templates** - header.html and footer.html
- ***plugins*** *(optional)* - extra features for your page

that's it! point your webserver at `output` or handle it however is best for your case.

**tip:** you can run `bearclaw` and it will run once, or you can use `./bearclaw --watch` to watch the current folder for changes.

## plugins
bearclaw supports plugins. plugins can be installed in the plugins folder and called in your markdown or html pages using an html comment. bearclaw will swap the comment for the contents of the plugin file at the specified path.

## issues

if you run in to issues, there's a short bug report form you can fill out, or you can contribute with a pull-request.
